# Black Lives Matter

All lives matter in _theory_. In practice, _not_ all lives matter because of
the systemic racism and injustice under which people of color have suffered
since the American continent was first colonized. Anyone who says otherwise
is wilfully blinding themselves to the truth.

It's not a zero-sum game, either. Only once Black lives matter, Brown lives
matter, indigenous lives matter, and LGBTQ+ lives matter, will all lives
truly matter. And when that day comes, _all_ lives will be better as a result.
