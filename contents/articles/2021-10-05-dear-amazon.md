# Dear Amazon Engineering Recruiters

tl;dr: No.

Look, I hate that I've gotten so many emails from Amazon engineering recruiters
that I even feel like this needs to be said, but I don't want to spend so much
as half a brain processing cycle on this again, and am tired of copy-and-pasting
the same response over and over, so I'll make it quick.

There are two reasons why my answer is no. The first is that I am very happy
with where I am now, and I have neither any intention to nor interest in any
changes any time even remotely soon. I've found a role as a senior SRE that has
been immensely fulfilling[^1], and at a company and with people that put their
money where their mouth is when it comes to being inclusive, fair, ethical, and
equitable, and there is no other place I would rather be for the forseeable
future.

The second is that I will never have any interest in working for Amazon, as a
result of their unethical treatment of their supply chain workforce and refusing
to take necessary measures to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 at their warehouses,
and their retaliatory firing of employees[^2] that attempted to organize and
advocate on behalf of improving their own coworkers' working conditions. The
National Labor Relations Board [substantiated][] that at least two of these
firings were retaliatory and illegal and filed a case on those workers' behalf,
and Amazon was forced to agree to a [humiliating][] out-of-court settlement —
requiring them to pay back wages and "post a notice to all of its tech and
warehouse workers nationwide that Amazon can’t fire workers for organizing and
[exercising their rights][]" — rather than face public excoriation in the
hearings process.

Tim Bray [resigned in protest][] as VP at AWS over the firings, and has [openly
celebrated][] the settlement and called for further judgements against Amazon
for the other employees whose firings are suspected of being related to their
involvement in employee activism. Consider every single word of his statements
and reasoning for leaving as my own for refusing to even consider working for
them:

> Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is
> it intrinsic to the function of free markets. It’s evidence of a vein of
> toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor
> drink that poison.

If you're an Amazon recruiter that comes across my website, or my profiles on
GitHub or LinkedIn, I hope you find this post and save yourself the time and
energy.

    It turns out that spending so much time on the infrastructure for my own
    projects, that I hardly ever wrote any actual code for my own projects, has
    its benefits after all.

[^2]: Incidentally, everyone fired was a woman and/or a person of color.
