Gabby Giffords graduated from [University High School][] in the year I was
born; 17 years later, while I was a senior at UHS, she was elected to
represent the Congressional district my family lived in; five years later, in
2011, she was critically injured in a mass shooting. Since then, she and her
husband have been courageous, omnipresent, and tireless in their [campaign][]
for sensible gun safety reforms. Captain Kelly has my unreserved and
enthusiastic endorsement for U.S. Senator from Arizona.
