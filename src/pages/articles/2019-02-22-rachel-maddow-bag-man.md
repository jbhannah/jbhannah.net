# “Bag Man,” a Rachel Maddow Podcast

If you caught Rachel Maddow's scoop last night about [what Spiro Agnew was up
to][] in the years after his resignation (and how he relates to the Justice
Department's regulations about [whether or not a sitting President can be
indicted][]), but haven't yet listened to "Bag Man," you owe it to yourself to
check it out. In fact, even if you haven't watched any of The Rachel Maddow
Show, you owe it to yourself to check "Bag Man" out anyway.
